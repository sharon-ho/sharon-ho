### Hi there 👋
I'm Sharon (she/her) and I'm currently studying Software Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal. 

My research interests include synthetic media, social impacts of artificial intelligence and technology for social good.

I enjoy doing data analysis with Python, web development with React and UI/UX design.

From design to implementation, I love being involved in all parts of the software development process. 

Open to all learning and internship opportunities!

[Switchboard](https://github.com/bean-pod/switchboard) as one of its front-end developers and UI/UX designers. It's a web service that enables peer-to-peer video streaming between senders and receivers. This project is my team's final year undergraduate Capstone project at Concordia University. It received high praise and a final letter grade of A+!
